## My process

### Built with

- [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For reordering animations
- [react](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to use framer-motion a little bit, read the documentation and made my first very simple implementation since it was a perfect fit for the bonus.
